\chapter{\textbf{Evaluation and Results}}

The system created during this thesis receives a command with the name of the object the robot should grasp. After it detects the object, the projection manager (section \ref{sec:sys_description}) requests several trajectories to the motion controller. These reach different grasping poses using both arms (one at a time).

In order to measure the quality of the trajectories obtained by the controller and decide if the grasping action was successful, these trajectories must be evaluated (section \ref{sec:traj_eval}).

The metrics considered for each trajectory are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Length
	\item Smoothness
	\item Convergence error
	\item Manipulability of the arm after reaching the goal
	\item Distance to collision
\end{itemize}

All trajectories that generate a collision or that do not reach a certain threshold distance around the grasping pose are discarded. The remaining trajectories are scored based on these metrics and the best one is sent to the robot.

In the simulated experiments, grasping is considered successful if the robot's EEF reached one of the defined grasping poses without collisions. For the experiments with the real robot, grasping was considered successful if the robot grasped and lifted the object.

\section{Experimental Setup}

The first experiments were made in simulation and visualized using RVIZ (section \ref{subsec:rviz}). Several initial configurations were tested. After achieving suitable results, experiments were done using the real robot.


\subsection{Scenario 1: Simulation}
\label{sub:scenario1}

The scenario simulates three objects detected on top of a table: a cup, a tomato sauce package (knorr tomate) and a bottle of pancake mix (mondamin). A model of the robot was loaded in this environment in front of the table (figure \ref{fig:env}). The table model and the general position of the robot with respect to it simulate the environment of the IAI's lab, the place where the experiments with the robot were done.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\vspace{-12pt}
	\caption[Simulation Environment]{Simulation Environment}
	\vspace{-15pt}
	\label{fig:env}
\end{figure}

Ten different initial configurations for the robot were defined. For each configuration, the robot had to grasp the three objects shown in figure \ref{fig:env}. The system was told to calculate five trajectories each time it received the request to grasp an object, and select the one with the best score.

For some of the initial configurations, the robot was positioned far away from the table, so that the objects were out of reach. This was done in order to test the base's movement. In other cases the robot was placed closer to the table, so that the arms and torso started moving from the beginning of the trajectory.

The experiments were repeated with three different poses for each object, giving a total of 90 grasping simulations.

\subsection{Scenario 2: Testing with the robot}

The second group of experiments was executed on the real robot. The robot was placed in front of a table where some objects from the database were placed. In this case, the trajectory evaluation included the execution time (the time the robot required to execute the given trajectory).

For this tests with the Boxy robot, grasping was considered successful if the robot could grasp and lift the object for at least 3 seconds. Twelve experiments were done, with three objects in four different positions. The initial pose of the robot was set per hand before each experiment, so there are variations between each pose.

 \begin{figure}[H]
 	\centering
 	{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{obj_location.jpg}}
 	\vspace{-12pt}
 	\caption[Objects location]{Location array of the objects during the experiments}
 	\vspace{-15pt}
 	\label{fig:loc}
 \end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:loc} shows the four locations where each object was placed during the grasping experiments.  During some experiments, objects were placed close to the object the robot grasped, to test if grasping in a packed environment could be achieved.

\section{Experimental Results}

Figure \ref{fig:exp} shows the results obtained by one iteration of the motion controller. In this case, the right arm of the robot has to grasp a cup located on a table out of reach for the robot.

Analyzing  the first two plots of figure \ref{fig:exp}, it can be seen how the weights dynamically change with the distance. These are the weights used in equation \ref{eq:h} to update the $\textbf{H}$ matrix, therefore, to update the cost function (equation \ref{eq:cost}) used by the controller. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{plots/weights} \\ \vspace{-10pt}
	\input{plots/error} \\ \vspace{-5pt}
	\input{plots/base_pos} \vspace{-8pt}
	\input{plots/base_vel} \vspace{-5pt}
	\input{plots/joint_vel} \vspace{-20pt}
	\caption[Trajectory Result]{Behavior during one simulated trajectory. Iteration $0$ to $\approx100$: base active. Iteration $\approx100$ to $\approx200$: Whole robot active. Iteration $\approx200$ on: Arm active, torso partially active.} \vspace{-15pt} \label{fig:exp}
\end{figure}

During the first hundred iterations, the robot is too far away from the table, so it will move only the base. Between a certain threshold, the base's weights starts increasing and the arm's and torso's weights decrease, the robot starts to use more the arm and torso and less the base. When Boxy approaches the table, the base's weight is high, so the movements are executed mainly with the arm.

At the beginning of the trajectory, the error decreases fast, because the robot is just approaching to the table moving the base. When only the arm and torso are active, the error converges slowly, since the controller must now consider not only position, but also orientation.

\subsection{Scenario 1: Simulation}
\label{res:sim}

Table \ref{table:sim} shows the scores obtained by each trajectory of the simulation experiments described in section \ref{sub:scenario1}.   Trajectories that did not reached the goal in a given time were considered as failed and were not evaluated. The scores of the trajectories with a collision are also not displayed since these trajectories were discarded. The evaluation was done as explained in section \ref{sec:traj_eval}.

To make the table easier to read and compare values, the failed trajectories are written below the successful ones.

\input{codes/scores} \vspace{-60pt}

For each object, the trajectory with lower score was selected as the one to be sent to Boxy. The implications of this table are discussed in the next chapter.

Table \ref{table:summary} shows a summary of the experiment results, classifying the trajectories in successful, failed or collision detected. From the 90 grasping actions simulated, $88.9\%$ were successful.

\subsection{Scenario 2: Testing with the robot}

After running the first experiments with the robot, I realized that some parameters had to be changed in order to successfully grasp objects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The pre-grasping pose has to be further away from the actual grasping pose to avoid collision between the gripper and the object. The distance changed from three to eight centimeters.
	\item The velocity limit of the base specified in the URDF is  $1\frac{m}{s}$, this is too high for the real robot. It was reduced to $0.3\frac{m}{s}$, because higher velocities caused the robot's structure to oscillate.
	\item The error margin of the pre-gasping pose also had to be reduced to avoid colliding with the object while approaching to the grasping pose.
\end{itemize}

One problem I noticed with the perception system is that the orientation of the fiducial markers used to detect the objects is not always correct, this can lead to a fail grasping. Usually rotating the objects corrected the problem.

Finally, I successfully ran experiments with Boxy. However, the process was slow due to the time required for collision detection, approximately 16 seconds per trajectory. Trying to reduce this time, I simplified the collision models of the objects. This reduced the average collision detection time to 9.2 seconds.

Table \ref{table:res_robot}  shows the results of the experiments I did on the robot after doing the changes mentioned above. It shows the time required by the robot to execute the trajectory, the position error with respect to the planned trajectory and the outcome of the grasping. The position error was calculated with the joint states measured by the robot, it was not taking into account possible errors in the base odometry.

There were problems with the detection of the cup, due the location of the markers. One of the markers was often detected closer than it really was, so the gripped did not reached the object.

In 10 out of the 12 experiments, the planner decided to grasp the pose located on top of the object, since, for most common configurations or the arm, is the easiest to reach.

Three examples of successful grasping are shown in figure \ref{fig:grasp}.

Figure \ref{fig:crowded} shows two scenarios where a successful grasping was made in a situation where the object to grasped was surrounded by other objects.

\end{figure}

During the tests, only one of the robots could be used due to a internal problem of the right arm, so no comparison between the results of each arm could be done. However, after tuning the system, most of the grasping actions were successful. No trajectory executed generated a collision, even when objects were near the goal position.
